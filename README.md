# Basic data visualizations with python
This study has been designed to visualize analyses conducted with Python and to contribute to decision-making processes

This document demonstrates how to quickly and simply transform a dataset into meaningful visualizations and graphics. The example dataset used here is the "Titanic" dataset. Below, you'll find descriptions of each variable in the Titanic dataset to help understand the data types available for analysis.

Data set comes from seaborne lib. (sns.load_dataset("titanic") )

# Explanation of each column in the Titanic dataset:
* survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived. 0 means the passenger did not survive, and 1 means they survived.

* pclass: Passenger class, representing the social class on the Titanic.

  1: First class
  2: Second class
  3: Third class
  
* sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female).

* age: Age of the passenger. There may be missing values in this column.

* sibsp: Number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard.

  Sib: Siblings
  Sp: Spouses

* parch: Number of parents or children the passenger had aboard.

  Par: Parents
  Ch: Children

* fare: The fare paid by the passenger for the ticket.

* embarked: The port where the passenger boarded the ship.

  C: Cherbourg
  Q: Queenstown
  S: Southampton
  
* class: Passengerâ€™s ticket class in a categorical format (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).

* who: Classification of the passenger based on age and gender (man, woman, or child).

* adult_male: Indicates whether the passenger is an adult male (True or False).

* deck: The deck where the passenger's cabin was located. This column may contain missing values.

* embark_town: The town where the passenger boarded the ship (Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton).

alone: Indicates if the passenger was traveling alone (True if alone, False if with family).

These columns help in analyzing various aspects of the passengers, such as demographics, socio-economic status, and their likelihood of survival.
